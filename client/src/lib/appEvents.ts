/**
 * @file appEvents.ts
 * @description Window events used to trigger app-wide chrome from anywhere in the
 * tree, plus the typed helpers that dispatch them.
 *
 * These live in `lib/` rather than beside the components that handle them for one
 * reason: the trigger and the handler are usually in different components, and
 * importing one component from the other creates a cycle (the sidebar opens the
 * palette; the palette asks the sidebar to check for updates). A shared module
 * breaks that without giving either component knowledge of the other.
 *
 * A window event is also the right coupling here regardless: no context provider,
 * no lifted state, and any component — or a test — can trigger the behavior.
